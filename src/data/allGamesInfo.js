      'The sequel to Soul Edge arrived in video arcades a year later, with an exclusive porting to the Dreamcast console in 1999. The plot is set two–three years after the first game\'s and the title is derived from Soul Calibur, a legendary weapon which opposes the evil of Soul Edge. Soul Calibur was also known as Soul Blade as an updated version which released on the Sega Dreamcast. This title would come to express the Soul series as a whole, establishing its popularity in video gaming history as it garnered positive reviews from gaming fans and critics. Though retaining elements of its predecessor, Soulcalibur incorporated an extensive number of new features, including the "8-Way Run".

      "Soulcalibur (ソウルキャリバー, Sōrukyaribā) is a weapon-based 3D fighting game developed by Project Soul and produced by Namco. It is the second game in the Soulcalibur series, preceded by Soul Edge in December 1995. Originally released in arcades in July 1998, it ran on the Namco System 12 hardware. It was ported to the Dreamcast in 1999 with new features and improved graphics. The North American version was released in September 1999 as a launch game for the Dreamcast and was part of the successful launch of the new console. It became available as a downloadable title on the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Marketplace in July 2008 and it is backwards compatible with the Xbox One along with the sequel. A sequel, Soulcalibur II, was released in July 2002.\nThe game centers on the pursuit of the legendary weapon known as Soul Edge, now in the possession of a warrior known as Nightmare, who slaughters countless people to satisfy the blade's bloodlust. Other warriors pursue him either to claim the weapon for themselves or to destroy it, end his mass murder, and free him of its curse.\nDeveloped closely with Namco's Tekken development team, it is one of few home console ports that outdid their arcade parent graphics-wise. The title brought many innovations to the fighting game genre that include a heavy emphasis on weapons and a unique eight-way movement system. Soulcalibur is widely regarded as one of the best Dreamcast titles and is often cited as among the greatest fighting games ever released, as well as one of the best video games of all time.",

      "Metroid Prime is a first-person action-adventure video game developed by Retro Studios and Nintendo for the GameCube video game console. It was released in North America on November 17, 2002, and in Japan and Europe the following year. Metroid Prime is the fifth main installment in the Metroid series, and the first Metroid game to use 3D computer graphics. Because exploration takes precedence over combat, Nintendo classifies the game as a first-person adventure rather than a first-person shooter. On the same day as its North American release, Nintendo also released the Game Boy Advance game Metroid Fusion, marking the return of the Metroid series after an eight-year hiatus following Super Metroid (1994).\nMetroid Prime is the first of the three-part Prime storyline, which takes place between the original Metroid and Metroid II: Return of Samus. Like previous games in the series, Metroid Prime has a science fiction setting in which players control the bounty hunter Samus Aran. The story follows Samus as she battles the Space Pirates and their biological experiments on the planet Tallon IV. The game was a collaboration between Retro's staff in Austin, Texas, and Japanese Nintendo employees, including producer Shigeru Miyamoto, who suggested the project after visiting Retro's headquarters in 2000.\nThe game garnered critical praise and commercial success, selling more than a million units in North America alone. It won a number of Game of the Year awards, and it is considered by many critics and gamers to be one of the greatest video games ever made, remaining one of the highest-rated games on Metacritic. In 2009, an enhanced version was released for the Wii as a standalone game in Japan, and as part of the Metroid Prime Trilogy compilation internationally.",

      "Super Mario Odyssey is a 3D platform game, a part of Nintendo’s Super Mario series. \n\n###Story \nThe game follows Mario on his quest to save Princess Peach from her forced marriage with Bowser. The game starts with Mario fighting Bowser on its aircraft. Bowers knock Mario off the ship and shreds his cap into pieces. Mario awakens in the Cap Kingdom inhabited with hat-like spirits and befriends one of them named Cappy. It turns out, Bowser also kidnapped Cappy’s sister Tiara, and now the heroes must chase Bowser through several kingdoms to save Peach and Tiara. \n\n###Gameplay \nThe gameplay of Super Mario Odyssey draws inspiration from Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. The game consists 17 levels (named as “kingdoms”). In most of them, your goal is to collect a certain amount of Power Moons. Collecting enough of them allows the player to progress to the next kingdom. Some moons can be found in different parts of the level or acquired as a reward for completing certain tasks or challenges. The Mario’s moveset mostly resembles that of Super Mario 64 and includes wall jumps, triple jumps, somersaults, long jumps, rolling on the ground. The main new gameplay feature is that Mario can throw his hat to create temporary platforms, grab objects, attack enemies, or possess them. Possessing enemies gives you new moves and sometimes is necessary to reach certain parts of the level.",

      "GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Rare and based on the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. It was released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in August 1997. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown. The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode in which two, three, or four players can compete in different types of deathmatch games.\nGoldenEye 007 was developed over a period of two and a half years by an inexperienced team led by Martin Hollis, who had previously worked on the coin-op version of Killer Instinct. It was partially conceived as an on-rails shooter inspired by Sega's Virtua Cop, before being redesigned as a free-roaming shooter. The game was highly acclaimed by the gaming media and sold over eight million copies worldwide, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game. It received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Games Award and four awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.\nRetrospectively, GoldenEye 007 is considered an important game in the history of first-person shooters for demonstrating the viability of game consoles as platforms for the genre, and for signalling a transition from the then-standard Doom-like approach to a more realistic style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, stealth elements, and a console multiplayer deathmatch mode. The game is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. A spiritual successor, Perfect Dark, was released in 2000, while a reimagining of the game, also titled GoldenEye 007, was released in 2010.",

      "Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed by Valve Corporation and released on April 19, 2011 on Steam, PS3 and Xbox 360. It was published by Valve Corporation in digital form and by Electronic Arts in physical form. \n\nIts plot directly follows the first game's, taking place in the Half-Life universe. You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her...\n\nPortal 2's core mechanics are very similar to the first game's ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.\n\nThe game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.\n\nPortal 2 also features a co-op mode where two players take on the roles of robots being led through tests by GladOS, as well as an in-depth level editor.",

Chrono Cross was designed primarily by scenarist and director Masato Kato, who had help from other designers who also worked on Chrono Trigger, including art director Yasuyuki Honne and composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Nobuteru Yūki designed the characters of the game.\nThe story of Chrono Cross focuses on a teenage boy named Serge and a theme of parallel worlds. Faced with an alternate reality in which he died as a child, Serge endeavors to discover the truth of the two worlds' divergence. The flashy thief Kid and many other characters assist him in his travels around the tropical archipelago El Nido. Struggling to uncover his past and find the mysterious Frozen Flame, Serge is chiefly challenged by Lynx, a shadowy antagonist working to apprehend him.\nUpon its release in Japan in 1999 and North America in 2000, Chrono Cross received critical acclaim, earning a perfect 10.0 score from GameSpot. The game shipped over 1.5 million copies worldwide, leading to a Greatest Hits re-release and continued life in Japan as part of the Ultimate Hits series. Chrono Cross was later re-released for the PlayStation Network in Japan in July 2011, and in North America four months later.",

The game is set in a fictional city during the 1980’s and exhibits a unique design of locations, people, and objects, resembling the real world’s counterparts of Vice City, mainly Miami, FL. GTA: Vice City is a fourth game of the series, following Grand Theft Auto III.\r\n\r\nThe main character is introduced as Tommy Vercetti, an Italian-American mobster who works for a wealthy crime family. Throughout the story, the player will observe as the protagonist rises the ranks, sometimes making decisions of questionable nobility or profit. Our goal as a player is to ensure that Vercetti becomes the boss of all of Vice City’s mafia, and various story characters will help us or prevent us from achieving this goal.\r\n\r\nThe worlds of Grand Theft Auto series have long been worked upon and have been done in much detail, and Vice City is no different. The people on the sidewalks, the stylish cars and neon light clubs, the sky-high buildings and lively piers and beaches, everything will bring nostalgic feelings to those of players, whose eyes have seen the glory of this time. The gameplay, however, bears little difference from its predecessor, continuing the trend of big guns, explosions, and cop chases.",

    release_date: "2008-01-01",
    description:
      "This is one of the most original events in the gaming industry - the simultaneous release of five AAA class games by Valve within one set.\n\nThe Orange Box is one “box” that was sold for the price of one full-fledged release of the AAA game, but included not one game, but five:\n\nHalf-Life 2,\nHalf-Life 2 Supplement: Episode One,\nHalf-Life 2 Supplement: Episode Two,\nPortal,\nTeam fortress 2\n\n###The situation around the release of The Orange Box\nThe appearance of The Orange Box had several reasons. The development of three games at Valve went in parallel and ended almost simultaneously. At the same time, the games industry has matured to redefine the relationship between game manufacturers and game sellers. In particular, the sellers did not want to trade additions to games.\n\n###Valve Solution\nBy this time, Valve had already had problems distributing Half-Life 2: Episode One and decided to release Half-Life 2: Episode Two in the same set with other games for the price of one big release.\n\nAs a result, not only Half-Life 2: Episode Two, but also games that were completely atypical for the market at that time: good multiplayer game Team Fortress 2 and a small indie game Portal, made good progress on the market.\n\nThe release of The Orange Box also solved the main problem of the game Portal. This game was so different from everything in the world of games that the producers didn’t really know exactly how to explain to people what this game was good for.\n\nAs part of the set, the game somehow fell into the hands of many people, they tried to play it, and later recognized its original features as its strengths and not its shortcomings. In particular, such a find as GLaDOS received great approval.\n\n###Half-Life 2 and its predecessors\nThis game is a sequel to Half-Life, released six years after the first game.\n\nThe first Half-Life has opened a new stage in the video game industry, especially in the shooter genre. Its innovations include:\n- the development of the plot completely inside the playing space without using video,\n- high artificial intelligence of opponents,\n- the hero has allies,\n- A new level of player interaction with the environment, as well as the constant need for such interaction for progress in the game. A lot of puzzles are also built on this interaction.\n\nThe game is not divided into levels or missions. The player sees only through the eyes of the main character - Gordon Freeman. The hero can not be seen from the side, you can not hear his voice - this is done to fully immerse the player in the game.\n\nThe arsenal of weapons in Half-Life is a combination of human (including powerful experimental) and alien weapons.\n\nIn addition to 14 types of weapons that the hero can carry with him, occasionally there are stationary weapons, which can also be used. There are also grenades and booby traps.\n\nThe action of the first half-life takes place in the underground Black Mesa Research Facility. They are experimenting with the so-called “Anomalous Material” - a crystal, the error in working with which opens a portal to another dimension, from which hostile aliens invade Earth.\n\nThe hero, Gordon Freeman, worked as a researcher at this place, and after the disaster he tries to get out of the complex, penetrate the alien dimension and destroy the leader of a hostile alien civilization, Nihilanth, to close the portal and stop the alien invasion. In the final of the first game Gordon succeeds.\n\nThere are three additions to the original Half-Life:\n- Half-Life: Opposing Force (1999),\n- Half-Life: Blue Shift (2001),\n- Half-Life: Decay (2001).\n\nThe events of the main plot and official additions occur simultaneously, as a result of which the paths of the characters can intersect, and the events can affect both the one addition and the others.\n\nSometimes you have to play is not a character of Gordon, and you can see Gordon from the side.\n\n###Half-Life 2\ncontinues the story about twenty years after the incident at Black Mesa, in one of the largest cities on Earth, located somewhere in Eastern Europe - City 17.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, Gordon Freeman finds himself on a train arriving in City 17, unarmed and without his protective suit. City 17 is ruled by a totalitarian government headed by Wallace Breen, former administrator of the Black Mesa research center. After the events of the first game, the power of aliens has been established all over the Earth - aliens rule through people who have passed to their side. Wallace Breen - the head of these traitors and the main agent of enemies.\n\nHalf-Life 2 has become an even more noticeable breakthrough for the video game industry. The main technological advances of Half-Life 2 are:\n- the new engine, which raised the level of character animation,\n- even more powerful artificial intelligence of opponents,\n- realistic physics of the game world,\n- even more intense interaction of the player with the environment,\n\n###Half-Life 2: Episode One\nThis is a continuation of the plot of Half-Life 2 and the first part of the trilogy of episodes - the sequels of Half-Life 2.\n\nFor much of Episode One, the player interacts with the computer character Alyx Vance. The plot of the episode continues the story of Half-Life and Half-Life 2, and begins from the moment at which the previous game ended.\n\nEpisode One is significantly shorter than Half-Life 2, all the action takes place in the City 17.\n\n###Half-Life 2: Episode Two\n - the second part in the trilogy of episodes, continuing the plot of the computer game Half-Life 2.\n\nThe creators of the game try to base each episode on a specific theme. As part of this strategy, Episode Two focuses on open spaces, long journeys (even by car) and less linear gameplay than in previous games in the Half-Life series. Locations include abandoned mines, ant-lion's nest and missile base.\n\nThe game develops immediately after the events of Episode One in a wooded area near the destroyed City 17.\n\nAlyx Vance is present in the game, but less active than in the previous episode\n\nEach following addition is noticeably more perfect technically. This is part of the game manufacturer's strategy, which thus solved the problem of a gradual development of the game and the absence of long waiting periods for consumers.\n\n###Portal\nThe events of the game Portal take place in the Half-Life universe, in the Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center. The heroine is a girl named Chell.\n\nThe gameplay is based on solving puzzles using a portable device Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. This device allows you to create portals on flat surfaces through which you can instantly move yourself or objects in space.\n\nAt the same time, only two portals can be opened, differing in color - blue and orange. When you open a new portal, the previously opened portal of the same color closes. In addition, portals of the same color can open on top of each other, while the portal “opposite” in color should be opened to the side.\n\nAs the game progresses, tasks become more difficult, and to solve it is necessary to combine various techniques. Obstacles also arise: walls on which it is impossible to create a portal, energy fields. Passing through such fields destroys the items that the player carries, and also closes the open portals, leaving only the device for creating them.\n\n###GLaDOS\nAn essential part of the game is the GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence and self-awareness supercomputer that was developed for the Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center, but went out of control and captured the Enrichment Center.\n\nGLaDOS is an abbreviation for \"Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System\". GLaDOS is a female character.\n\nIn the game Portal GLaDOS is both the enemy of the player and his guide to the Enrichment Center. GLaDOS observes and controls the passage of tests, gives instructions on the use of objects of the Enrichment Center, sometimes gives advice and cautions. The voice of GLaDOS accompanies the player throughout the game, but until the very end it is unknown who or what GLaDOS is and what role it plays in Aperture Science.\n\n###Team fortress 2\nTeam Fortress was originally created as a modification for the Quake game. The success of this game led to the development of Team Fortress 2 - a game separate from Quake. The game with this name appeared after many years of work. The game had its own visual style and plot, full of hidden and explicit meanings. By genre, the game Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer team shooter.\n\n###Plot\nThe world of Team Fortress 2 is the arena where the organizations RED and BLU, created by the Mann brothers, Blutarch and Redmond, secretly confront. The brothers competed for the land of the father.\n\nRED - short for Reliable Excavation & Demolition. RED builds reservoirs, mines, produces bread and beer. The buildings of RED and its equipment are painted in red and yellow, the main building materials are wood, red brick and dark red metal sheets.\n\nBLU is short for Builders League United. The company builds hydroelectric power plants, owns dairy farms. Buildings BLU are made in blue and white colors of white brick and metal.\n\nRED and BLU are waging an irreconcilable struggle, which takes various forms - from unfair competition in business to armed clashes between specially hired mercenaries.\n\nClashes take the form of seizing and holding control of territory, seizing important heights, destroying enemy bases and industrial espionage.\n\nClashes between companies take place at various industrial sites, such as mines, reservoirs, quarries and power plants. The secret bases of corporations, computer centers and rocket bunkers under the guise of such organizations are often hidden.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game takes place on separate territories, called game maps. Each map refers to one of several game modes.\n\nTwo teams take part in the game, which differ in the color of the form - Red and Blue - these are mercenaries of two opposing companies.\n\nTeams consist of characters that can be live players or bots. Each class of characters has weapons in their arsenal, allowing them to attack opponents from the other team, and other things designed for different purposes.\n\n###Game modes\nGame mode defines the tasks of each team on the map.\n\nCapture The Flag\nCapture the files\nControl Points (in two versions: Symmetric Control Point and Attack / Defense)\nTerritory control\nPayload\nArena\nPayload race\nKing of the hill\nSpecial Delivery\nMann vs. Machine\nRobot Destroy\nPass time\n\nThe game has several classes of playing characters, quite different from each other. In numerous additions to the game there are changes and additions for the game modes, and for individual classes of characters.",

      "###The roots\nOne of the classic representatives of the first-person shooter genre. Designed and released in 1996 by the authors of the groundbreaking game Doom - iD Software. This is the first game to start the still ongoing series. Unlike its famous predecessor, the game uses an engine capable of rendering full-fledged 3D: the game supports an earlier version of 3D acceleration through OpenGL. After moving to a new engine, the game needed a new control scheme: the movement is now possible in all three directions, including the vertical axis. This feature added to the game an additional difficulty: player have to expect the enemy attack from any direction. The game also has a full-fledged multiplayer, the previous version of which the Doom players liked.\n\n###Key features\nIn a single player campaign, the player takes control of the main character named Ranger, who went to the portal in order to stop the unknown enemies, code-named Quake. The plot of the adventure consists of 32 separate levels. Six more maps are available in multiplayer for the battles between the players for deathmatch mayhem. Two mission packs were released for the game, which adds new enemies, new levels, new maps, new weapons and a new experience for players to the original game.

Nations hire private military corporations instead of having their own armies. The  War Economy emerges with the Sons Of the Patriots system controlling the PMCs. Soldiers are infused with nanomachines that control their behavior on the battlefield, and the weapons are ID-locked. Liquid Ocelot sets out to hijack the system to use in his own interests. Solid Snake grows old rapidly and gets ready for his last mission in order to kill Liquid and save the world once again.\n\n###Gameplay\nSnake is proficient in Close quarters combat and stealth infiltration. Players are deployed on the battlefield with a wide arrange of gadgets at their disposal, such as the OctoCamo that allows for replicating any surface the player is close to or a Solid Eye that serves as the game's HUD. It is essential to keep an eye on Snake's stress level. As the protagonist's stress level increases, it gets harder to aim, Snake suffers more damage, and it is easier to get knocked out in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nA VR mode is also present in the game where players can learn about the weapons they can use and master the CQC.",

Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, he ventures into the brutal Norse wilds with his son Atreus, fighting to fulfill a deeply personal quest. \r\n\r\nHis vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. \r\n\r\nKratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. \r\n\r\nFrom the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War’s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise. \r\n\r\nWith an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling.

      "Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a crossover platform fighting game for the Nintendo Wii published by Nintendo in 2008 and the third entry in the Super Smash Bros. series. It was developed by an ad hoc development team consisting of staff from Sora Ltd, GAME ARTS, Monolith Soft, HAL Laboratory and Paon.\n\nLike the two precedent instalments, the game features characters, locations and items from various Nintendo video game franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda or Kirby. However, Brawl is the first game to include characters from third-party franchises, such as Sonic the Hedgehog or Solid Snake from the Metal Gear series. \n\nThe Smash Bros. series is notable among fighting games for its unorthodox gameplay. A game takes place on a stage that could be compared to a platform game level. Instead of a health bar, damage is represented by a percentage. When a player hits another, the victim's percentage increases. The higher the percentage, the further a player will be knocked away when hit. The goal is to knock other players out of the screen using a varied set of moves. Two to four players can fight at the same time, either in a free-for-all match or a team battle. Special rulesets also allow for different win conditions.\n\nItems randomly appear around the stage and can be picked up and used by fighters to aid in combat. These include food that heals the user, various weapons such as laser swords or firework launchers, or even Pokéballs containing powerful Pokémon. Brawl also introduces Assist Trophies, items that allow one to summon characters from various franchises to fight for them temporarily, as well as Smash Balls, which, when broken, allow a fighter to unleash their ultimate attack on their opponents. The game also supports custom rulesets, allowing players to disable items if they wish.\n\nBrawl is the first game in the series to include a complete single-player story campaign, named the Subspace Emissary. It features all the playable characters in the midst of a conflict against a mysterious entity looking to collect pieces of their world for an unknown reason. The player fights hoards of enemies throughout a multitude of platforming levels. It was also the first game to allow online play with friends or random players. This feature is no longer available due to the discontinuation of the Wii's online service in May 2014\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Brawl was praised by the critic for its fun and easy to learn gameplay, its sheer density and the attention put into the representation of its featured franchises. However, it left many fans of the series, particularly its competitive aspect, disappointed. The changes made to the gameplay from Melee considerably slowed the pace of the game and severe balance issues existed, which resulted in the game's competitive scene becoming inactive early in its life. To fix these issues, players resorted to modding. Among the various mods that were created was Project M, a mod that, at first, aimed to make Brawl feel more like its predecessor Melee, and later grew to become much more distinct from any game in the series. Project M gathered a decently sized competitive scene to the point where it was played at major tournaments along with the official games, but its development eventually shut down in 2015.\n\nDespite this, Brawl is the eight best-selling game on the Wii, having sold 13.29 million units as of March 2018. It is often considered to be the best Smash Bros. game for casual play or single-player.",

However, the damage meter increases the character's chances to be knocked out. Each fighter has a limited number of lives and loses one when he or she is knocked out. The player is eliminated when he or she loses all lives.\r\n\r\n###Multiplayer\r\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate includes several competitive multiplayer modes. Besides the traditional versus mode, there are several new modes not featured in the previous games.

The developers explained their decision: one hundred million people already playing on PlayStation 2, whereas on the next-generation console gamers were just going to adopt the new hardware.\n\n###Key features\nThe player controls Kratos, who in the first part killed the god of war Ares and took his place. The game heavily relies on the ancient Greek mythology and uses it as inspiration and the main source for enemies and NPC design as well as locations design. However, the game is not a great source of accurate historical facts: Ancient Greece history was rewritten for the sake of the genre and the game universe, the rules of which were established in the first part.\n\n###The story\nKing of the gods Zeus betrays Kratos and kills him, but the Spartan is saved from the Underworld by another goddess Gaia, who invites Kratos to find the Sisters of Fate and go to the past and prevent his own murder. The gameplay remained the same: the player can use several attacks, which can be combined and improved with the help of the in-game currency collected from enemies. The game has a lot of Quick-Time-Events, mostly they are used in battles with bosses and in finishing combo-moves. Bosses in the game, in comparison with the first part, significantly increased.",

It is the second game in the Super Smash Bros. series, following the 1999 release of the original game. It was released in Japan and North America in 2001, and in Europe and Australia in 2002.\nThe game features characters from Nintendo video game franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, and Pokémon. The stages and gameplay modes make references to, or take their designs from these franchises as well. Melee includes all playable characters from the first game in the series on the Nintendo 64 and also adds characters from franchises such as Fire Emblem, of which no games had been released outside Japan at the time. Melee's gameplay system offers an unorthodox approach to the fighting game genre with a counter that measures damage with increasing percentages, rather than a depleting health bar seen in most fighting games. It builds on the first game by adding new gameplay features and playable characters. Following the popularity of its multiplayer gameplay, Melee has been featured in many competitive gaming tournaments, and is one of the most popular fighting games for competitive play.\nThe game received critical praise, as well as awards and acknowledgements from gaming publications. It achieved strong sales upon release, and is the GameCube's best-selling game, with more than 7 million copies sold by March 2008. It is considered to be one of the best video games of all time.",

Vagrant Story was primarily developed by the team responsible for Final Fantasy Tactics, with Yasumi Matsuno serving as producer, writer and director.\nThe game takes place in the fictional kingdom of Valendia and the ruined city of Leá Monde. The story centers on Ashley Riot, an elite agent known as a Riskbreaker, who must travel to Leá Monde to investigate the link between a cult leader and a senior Valendian Parliament member, Duke Bardorba. In the prologue, Ashley is blamed for murdering the duke, and the game discloses the events that happen one week before the murder.\nVagrant Story is unique as a console action-adventure role-playing game in that it features no shops and no player interaction with other characters; instead, the game focuses on weapon creation and modification, as well as elements of puzzle-solving and strategy. The game received critical acclaim from gaming magazines and websites.",

      "Forza Motorsport 3 is an auto simulator game developed by Turn 10 Studios. It is the third game in the Forza Motorsport franchize.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe main game mode is Season Play. The players are given three events to choose from, which consist of three to five races at the beginning of the game. On the last day of the second week, a championship takes place. Each season has more and more season races. \r\n\r\nForza Motorsport 3 has a car class system that depends on the Performance Index. 11 performance classes are present in the game. Performance Index is calculated by evaluating the car's base stats, such as Speed, Handling, Acceleration, Launch, and braking. The Performance Index can be increased by buying car upgrades or decreased if the car's weight gets bigger or the players decide to switch the drivetrain.\r\n\r\nThe players can create completely custom designs of their vehicles and later upload them to the internet. It is even possible to record videos through the in-game photo mode and upload them to the Forza Motorsport 3 website. \r\n\r\n###Multiplayer\r\nThe game features a competitive multiplayer mode, which pits eight players against each other on any track available in the game. The multiplayer lobbies are fully customizable, which allows for creating both realistic races like an actual 24 hour Le Mans marathon on Circuit de la Sarthe or teaming up together for a fun drift session.",

The single-player campaign invites players to go through the episodic story, where players control six different characters. And even though the stories are taking place in different locations, the events of the campaign are happening simultaneously, creating the sense of urgency and painting a large-scale picture of the events.\r\nMultiplayer side of things in the Call of Duty series has been more popular among the players. A lot of features, not present in the single-player campaign, will be available to the player, such as a killstreak mechanic, that rewards players for killing multiple enemies without dying. Multiplayer maps consist of team-based and deathmatch based game modes, where players take on the objectives in order to complete the map mission or to obtain the largest amount of kills. Depending on how well the player does, they will be rewarded with experience points, which will allow them to level up and unlock new weapons, abilities, and perks for the playable classes.",

In the Steam community, there are still enthusiastic nostalgic reviews of almost everything that concerns Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. And there is an explanation for this. The game was released in 2005 and became the third in the Splinter Cell series. Canadian studio Ubisoft Montreal was engaged in the development, who is also responsible for Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. Critics and player noted the Xbox and PC versions of the game as the best. \n\n###The story\nIn Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, the player will feel like a professional spy, NSA agent Sam Fisher from a special unit called “The Third Echelon.” The plot takes its origin from the first game in the series. However, the narrative is constructed in such a way that the player does not necessarily have to go through it in order to enjoy the story. The events of the game occur in different parts of the Earth that are based on places from the real world. At the heart of the game is the conflict unfolding between China, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan.\n\nIn addition to a single user campaign, there is the possibility of playing on the net. However, the official online services for this game were disabled as early as August 2016. Despite this, players still have the opportunity to play on the local network or, with due skill - through third-party services.",

Archadia's invasion and the subsequent death of the Dalmascan king prompted the Princess Ashe, the sole surviving heir to the Dalmascan throne, to take up arms against the invaders. In her struggle to oust the occupying Archadian forces and restore freedom to her people, Ashe must watch as many of her allies pay the blood price for that freedom. Though tempted to abandon all hope in the face of the Empire's might, her determination keeps her from succumbing before what would seem to be inevitable defeat. Then she meets Vaan, an urchin from the Dalmascan capital of Rabanastre. Vaan dreams of one day becoming a sky pirate, escaping the Empire on his airship. Vaan, Ashe, Vaan's friend Penelo, the sky pirate Balthier, his partner Fran and many more are on an adventure through Ivalice that traces the mysteries behind the Archadian Empire's invasion. Bringing with it a wide array of new gameplay elements, Final Fantasy XII will change the way players think about the Final Fantasy series. Numerous possibilities abound within each scenario, allowing for a less linear, more unique experience for each player. The game also supports Dolby Pro Logic II both in-game and during movie sequences, immersing the player in the middle of the action.",

      'Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is a first person action-adventure video game developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo for the GameCube video game console. It is the seventh published game in the Metroid series, a sequel to Metroid Prime, and the first game in the series with a multiplayer feature. Echoes was released in North America, Europe, and Australia in 2004; and in Japan under the name Metroid Prime 2: Dark Echoes in May 2005.\nThe story of Echoes follows bounty hunter Samus Aran after she is sent to rescue Galactic Federation Marines from a ship near Aether, a planet inhabited by a race known as the Luminoth. There, she discovers that the troops were slaughtered by the Ing, a race that came from an alternate dimension of Aether. Samus must travel to three temples to ensure the destruction of the Ing, while battling Space Pirates and her mysterious doppelgänger called Dark Samus.\nRetro decided to make the game different from its predecessor by adding more focus on storyline and including new gameplay elements. Nintendo launched a viral marketing campaign to promote the game that included several websites written as if taking place in the Metroid universe. Echoes\' single player mode and graphics were praised by critics, while its steep difficulty level and multiplayer components were met less positively. Since its release, Echoes has received several video game industry awards, as well as spots on "top games" lists by Nintendo Power and IGN. Over 800,000 copies of the game were sold worldwide. In 2009, an enhanced version was released for Wii as a standalone game in Japan and as part of Metroid Prime: Trilogy internationally.',

Players control the protagonist as he climbs platforms, jumps on the enemies to defeat them and to collect keys to hidden quests and mosaic parts. Players have to lead Tim through 6 worlds, each based on an intriguing time mechanic, as Tim features the ability to rewind the original pace of time. For example, Time and Forgiveness world allows respawning Tim after his death by switching time back. To attend the last level, Tim must assemble the mosaic. The story ends in the world simply called “1”, where time flows in reverse and returns to the normal pace by rewinding. The last room of the final world contains Tim’s meeting with the princess, but, due to the time pace turned back, players face some unpredictable twists of the plot.",

      "Conker's Bad Fur Day is a platformer video game developed by Rare and released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in 2001. As part of the Conker video game series, the game follows the story of Conker the Squirrel, a greedy, heavy-drinking red squirrel who attempts to return home to his girlfriend Berri. The gameplay is composed of various challenges that involve platforming, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and gathering objects. The game also features a multiplayer mode where a maximum of four players can compete in seven different game types.\nAlthough visually similar to Rare's family-oriented Nintendo 64 platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day was designed for mature audiences and features graphic violence, alcohol and tobacco use, profanity, vulgar humor and pop culture references. It was developed over the course of four years and was originally intended for a family audience, but was ultimately retooled into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform games.\nUpon release, Conker's Bad Fur Day received critical acclaim from video game journalists, who praised its visual appeal and smart, funny humour. The game sold well below expectations due to limited advertising and a release towards the end of the Nintendo 64's life cycle, but has since earned a cult following due to its unique styling. A remake, Conker: Live & Reloaded, was released for the Xbox in 2005. In 2015, the game was included as part of the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One.",

To survive and find out what happened, the protagonist sets out to explore the dimly lit corridors of Von Braun, encountering his former friends mutated into abominations. The player can use guns, but ammunition is scarce, which forces the player to use it prudently and move ahead with caution.\n\nThe game was created by Ken Levine, the Irrational Games founder and famous designer behind such titles as BioShock and Thief: The Dark Project.

It is a top-secret organization named Third Echelon. The agency has access to cutting-edge surveillance and military technologies. Third Echelon's agents are free to violate any law as long as it is required to complete the mission successfully.\n\nIn 2004, contact is lost with a CIA agent. Homeland security sends a second agent to check on the CIA's asset, yet contact is lost again. Third Echelon sends Sam Fischer to investigate the situation.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game's main focus is to hide from the enemy instead of going loud and gun-blazing. The players have to leave no trace of themselves. It is essential to stick to the shadows, use the environment for cover and carefully pick your equipment to avoid detection.\n\nShadows are the best friend of the player. A special indicator is present on an in-game HUD that shows if the players are visible to their enemies. The game does not welcome the usage of weapons as the sound of gunfire is very loud and can be heard from the distance. The players have to rely on headshots, as they don't have much ammo on them. Sam has multiple advanced gadgets to aid him in his mission as well as a lot of hand-to-hand combat experience.",

Instant Action mode is a traditional deathmatch, while Power Struggle mode features two teams (designed to look like American and North Korean) trying to destroy each other’s bases.',

By ringing the four bells across the land, Klonoa can restore harmony, but the Sky Pirate Leorina is in hot pursuit, after Klonoa's magic ring...\n\nKlonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil is a 3D side-scrolling platformer. The main goal of the game is to get to the end of each level (or 'Vision'), but there are also special goals to achieve. Firstly, each Vision contains six Momett Dolls hidden in each level. Secondly, there are Dream Stones scattered throughout each level - green ones are worth one, while blue ones are worth five. Certain puzzles also contain tricky use of the \"Dream Spirit\", which doubles the value of all collected Dream Stones. New to Klonoa 2 are hoverboard sections, which play at a faster, more action-oriented pace.\n\nBut what makes Klonoa unique is his abilities. Klonoa can shoot a 'wind bullet' into foes, which puffs them up and allows Klonoa to carry them. Klonoa can then launch them straight at foes, or jump with them, giving him an extra boost. If he needs extra length to his jump, holding the jump button will allow him to hover for a little longer, too. Different enemies have different effects - for example, certain foes have propellers on their heads and will rocket you into the sky, while others will act like time bombs and explode after a short while.",

You can only claim railroad parts if you have enough railway car cards that match the road’s color. The amount of train pieces you spend depends on the length of the railroad fragment. \nClaiming routes and connecting cities on your Destination Ticket card give you points at the end of the game. However, incomplete tickets make you lose points. The player with the most points wins the match. \n\n### Downloadable content  \nTicket to Ride features several DLCs in the form of extra maps.

Year of the Dragon introduced new characters and minigames to the series, as well as offering improved graphics and music.\nUpon release, the game sold more than two million units in the United States and received critical acclaim. Reviewers noted the game built on the successful formula of its predecessors by adding more games and expansive environments. It was followed by the multiplatform title Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly. It was later re-released under the Greatest Hits label, fixing numerous bugs as well as adding additional music.',

      "Resident Evil 2 is the remake of the 1998 game of the same name. \n\n###Plot\nThe plot of the remake is identical to that of the original game. The story follows the survivors of a zombie virus outbreak in the fictional Raccoon City. There are two protagonists: Claire Redfield, a high school student, and Leon Kennedy, a policeman. They both search for the ways to escape the infested city. Companions, such as Ada Wong and Sherry, occasionally follow the protagonists. The characters eventually uncover the dark secrets of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus as a biological weapon, and fight its monsters, such as the Tyrant.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls either Leon or Claire from the third person view in a 3D environment. The two protagonists' storylines are intertwined. The player can complete the scenario playing one of the protagonists, and then replay it from the other character's POV, with all his previous actions taken into account. The game combines puzzle solving with zombie fights. Both protagonists use firearms as their main weapon; however, ammo is scarce.\n\n###Changes from the original\nBesides the updated graphics, the remake features a new camera and controls. In the original game, the controls were relative to the position of the player's character rather than the camera. The remake uses an over the shoulder camera, and the movements are relative to its angle. There's also no more loading screens, and the characters move between locations seamlessly.",

      'FEZ is a 2D and 3D game at the same time. Even though it is a platformer game in which you solve puzzles in the dimension your looking at, you can manipulate with the world itself by rotating it all around. Because of that very interesting mechanic that is not so popular in the industry, the game is actually is a 2D in a 3D world. In order to proceed from one level to another, you have to collect cubes or fragments of it. However, by rotating the world, you can actually gain access to some places that wouldn\'t be available without this mechanic. \n\nGomez, our protagonist, must restore the order in his universe by passing through the levels and collecting little fragments of it. But he will face no threat at all. Your only challenge is to actually beat these quite peculiar puzzles, basically without any guidelines at all. As stated by a developer himself, this game is about "stop and smell the flower", which makes it a brilliant stress-relief or a relaxing sort of the game with slow gameplay and nice atmosphere.',

With Dark Souls II the main director and founder of Souls-like genre Hidetaka Miyazaki took place only as a supervisor of the project, leaving a place of the director of the game for two young video game designers Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura. One could ask if the game is as good and beautiful as other past games in the Series and the answer would be that Dark Souls II is different yet deep and unforgiving as all the other titles in the series. The famous difficulty of previous games is still there but the world is much simpler yet connected and dangerous. Enemies still respond after death of a player but only about 15 times. After that they disappear forever. Boss battles are much simpler, this time focuses on many simpler bosses at a time instead of one powerful boss. \nDark Souls II is one of those games which were painfully downgraded in a favor of hardware of consoles, that means that players got less graphically advanced version than promised. Yet the game is interesting and deep and it’s definitely a must play for every Souls fan.",

      'Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow is a side-scrolling platforming video game developed and published by Konami for the Game Boy Advance. It is the third and final installment of the Castlevania series on the Game Boy Advance and was released in North America on May 6, 2003 and in Japan on May 8, 2003. Producer Koji Igarashi, who had led the production teams for previous Castlevania titles, led Aria of Sorrow\'s development as well. Michiru Yamane also returned to compose the music for the game alongside Takashi Yoshida and Soshiro Hokkai. Director Junichi Murakami was new to the Castlevania series.\nAria of Sorrow is set in the year 2035, when Dracula has long been sealed away after a battle in 1999. The plot follows the journey of Soma Cruz, a teenager granted occult power as a result of being a potential vessel of Dracula\'s reincarnation, as he battles dark figures that wish to inherit the undead lord\'s power. The game incorporates the same combination of elements from platform games and role-playing video games as in the previous game Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Aria of Sorrow introduces several new features to the series, such as the "Tactical Soul" system and employs a futuristic storyline in contrast to the medieval setting of many other Castlevania games.\nAlthough Aria of Sorrow sold poorly in Japan, selling only 27,000 units nearly one month after its release, it was commercially successful in the United States, with more than 158,000 units sold in the three months following its release. Aria of Sorrow received praise from several video game publications, with some considering it one of the best games in the Castlevania series since Symphony of the Night. Konami released a sequel to Aria of Sorrow, titled Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, on August 25, 2005 in Japan. It incorporated many elements from its predecessor, including the "Tactical Soul" system. Aria of Sorrow was re-released as part of Konami\'s "Konami the Best" line on November 3, 2005 in Japan, and in a dual pack with Harmony of Dissonance, titled the Castlevania Double Pack, in North America on January 11, 2006.',

      "STREET FIGHTER IV is a fighting game, the fourth main installment in Capcom’s Street Fighter series.  \n\n###Plot \nStorywise the game is a sequel to Street Fighter II and prequel to Street Fighter III. The S.I.N corporation begins a new tournament for the best fighters from all over the world. Although each participant has its reason to take part in the tournament, the S.I.N’s motivation behind it is to collect necessary data from fighters to complete a bio-weapon project BLECE.  \n\n###Gameplay \nLike most other games in series, Street Fighter IV is a 2D fighting with one-on-one fights between various characters with unique fighting styles and supernatural abilities. The core gameplay is very reminiscent to that of the Street Fighter II, but the game adds many new mechanics, gameplay elements as well as new characters, stages, game modes. The two main gameplay innovations in SFIV are Focus Attacks and Ultra Combos. Focus Attacks are chargeable attacks that can knock down an opponent. It can also absorb one opponent’s strike which gives a new layer to the game combat and makes gameplay less combo-based and more focused on reading the opponent’s moves and fast reactions. Super Combo gauge returns for previous games and allows the player to perform more powerful versions of character’s special attacks. The new Ultra Combo system fills a special Ultra Combo gauge with each hit laid on your character and allows you to unleash a string of powerful attacks on the enemy.",

The storyline is centered around the event known as Blight, which occurs once in several hundred years and marks the demonic invasion in the world of Thedas.  \nThe player creates its character by choosing its appearance, class, and race. There are 3 and three races in Dragon Age. The classes are the warrior, mage, rouge, and races are human, elf, and dwarf. The combination of class and race determines the character’s background story and the beginning of the game. \nThe interaction between the player, his teammates and NPC’s is an integral part of the game. The game’s storyline often makes the player take moral decisions which affect his later interaction with characters and the game world in general.",

The development of the game was funded through Kickstarter.\n\n###Treasure Trove Edition features\nTreasure Trove is a complete Shovel Knight package. This edition features all the campaigns released to this day. \n\n###Setting\nThe base campaign named Shovel Of Hope tells the tale of a vigilant Shovel Knight. He got separated from his lover, Shield Knight while exploring the mysterious Tower of Destiny. Devastated from such an event, the Shovel Knight lives alone, until the mysterious Order of No Quarter emerges. The Knight can cope with all of this and abandons his boring life in order to save the valley he lives in and enter the Tower of Destiny once again. \n\nAll other campaigns add details to the story of the base game.\n\n###Gameplay\nShovel Knight: Treasure Trove resembles a classic 2D sidescroller. It was heavily influenced by the Ninja Gaiden-era platformers. The main objective of the game is to finish all the main stages. The players unlock new levels by completing a certain number of previously unlocked ones. \n\nThe game features numerous boss encounters, most of which appear at the end of the stage and serve as a finishing point of the level. This makes the defeat of the boss need to be achieved to complete a stage. \n\nOn his way through the levels, the Knight can stumble across several treasures which can be used for purchasing equipment upgrades.",

Let alone two planets, both Helghan and Vekta are dwelled by humans after the Earth became uninhabitable. Killzone 2 explores a superplanet conflict through the eyes of Vekatn officer named Tomas "Sev" Sevchenko who is eager to find out the reasons conflict have burned up. \nOne of the main attraction of a gameplay part is multiplayer — the first installment has not starred it.

      "Forza Motorsport 4 is the fourth game in its series that allows the player to race a variety of 500 cars.\r\n\r\n###Modes\r\nThe main career mode is called World Tour Mode. It allows the player to race a series of challenges to receive a better car as a reward. 26 locations include famous real-world tracks, such as Hockenheimring and Indianapolis. There's also a multiplayer mode that supports up to 16 players\r\n\r\n###Changes from previous games\r\nThere are several differences between Forza Motorsport 4 and its predecessors. One of the most notable is the automatically adjusted difficulty. The game keeps track of the user's score and abilities and alters the AI and speed of the rival drivers accordingly. Another new feature is that the player can choose the prize car he or she receives.\r\n\r\nThere's also a new option called Autovista. In this mode, the player can explore a car in details, both inside and outside of it, including the parts not usually seen. Autovista provides the user with information about certain parts of the car through the voice messages. There are 24 cars that the player can observe in this mode.\r\n\r\n###Controls\r\nBeing an Xbox 360-only game, Forza Motorsport 4 allows the player to use Kinect as part of the controls. When included, Kinect can control either the vehicle or the player's vision. In the former mode, the game uses automatic acceleration and deceleration, while the player steers an imaginary wheel. In the latter mode, Kinect tracks the player's head movements to let the user look left, right, or back.",

It tells the story of Raziel, a lieutenant vampire in the Kain's army. Kain almost kills Raziel and throws him down the Lake of the Dead. However, an elder god saves Raziel from death and turns him into a Soul Stealer to help him take revenge on Kain. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game is completely different from its predecessor. The game is played from the third person with the player being able to move it by themselves.\n\nThe gameplay is based on the ability to travel between the material and spirit worlds. This allows the player to continue on the game's plot. The item interaction in the spirit world is limited, yet it also benefits Raziel as he can pass the gates that he is unable to go through in the material world. Many of the game's puzzles are based on the differences between these two worlds. The puzzle environment of the material world can be completely different in the spirit one.\n\nThe game's combat system is based on the hack and slash principle and consists out of multiple attacks and finishing moves. The enemies of Raziel are divided into three groups: humans, spirit beings, and vampires. The main feature of the combat system is the usage of the in-world items as your own weapons.",

      "###The Legacy\nOverwatch is a multiplayer first-person shooter from the company that gave players the saga of Azeroth, Starcraft and the Diablo universe. Despite these releases coming out years ago, they are still alive and actively updated. But the developers at Blizzard wanted something new: the company does not like to experiment with new settings, preferring to transfer existing characters to new genres, worlds, and situations. The exception, perhaps, can only be a game about the three Vikings—The Lost Vikings, but this, too, was a long time ago.\n\n###The story and setting\nAnyway, the company Blizzard has approached the development of Overwatch with team-specific meticulousness to details and desire to create an elaborative game universe. The player faces a choice between 21 characters who were part of the elite Overwatch unit. The task of Overwatch soldiers is to protect the Earth from conflicts and external threats. But something goes wrong, and the team of heroes breaks up. Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar.\n\n###Continuous support\nThe game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins.",
